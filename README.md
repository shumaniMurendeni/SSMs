# State Space Models
State Space Models (SSM) are models which use state variables to describe a system. State variables cannot
be measured during the data collecction process but can be reconstructed from the observed data. Such
models were first developed and used in space tracking settings but have since seen an increase in adoption
rate in other fields. Today, they are used in displines like finance, ecology and medicine to name a few.
As SSMs are structured to be able to differentiate between two sources of variability: process variation
and measurement variation resulting from sampling, they have became desirable among ecologists mostly
(Auger-Méthé,2016).

The paper by Auger-Méthé focused on an ecological example and used that alone to come to a
conclusion. This should make us ask if this conclusion applies to other settings in which SSMs are used. We
are going to investigate if the reported problems arise in finance and precipitation modelling.
